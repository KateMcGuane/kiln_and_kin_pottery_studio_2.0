  ### Surface

*SAMPLE*
The website is designed with three separate pages. This is to ensure ease of use, and for the length of each page to remain concise on a mobile device. It has an intuitive interface with clear navigation. This is emphasised with colour and imagery, allowing for quick access to facilities and respective socials.


  #### Colour Scheme

  There is a great emphasis on ...... for this website. I wanted it to reflect... <br>
  The colour scheme of the website illustrates...

  ![Hero Image](assets/images/hero.png)

  This palette holds...Many of the colours were extracted from this image and are accented throughout the website.

  ![Website Colour Palette](docs/colour-palette.png)

  This palette extracts......found in the hero image. It is used primarily for defining elements such as headings, areas of importance or quick reference.

  ![Website Colour Palette](docs/colour-palette-2.png)

  Both colour palettes were created using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.


  #### Typography

  ![Name of Font](filepath/to/font/image.PNG)
*SAMPLE*
    - This font has an illustration-type quality to it, which reflects the theme of the website. It adds some fun, looks hand-drawn and mirrors the chosen style of favicon. It is illustrative, yet has a structural integrity and readability to it. Furthermore, it effortlessly reflects what the website is about. This is primarily used for the website heading "Hobby".

  [Name of font](https://link_to_font_here)

![Name of Font](filepath/to/font/image.PNG)
*SAMPLE*
    - This is a legible, sans serif font with many varieties of weight to choose from. It is versatile and accomodates all structural styling needs. It is a very accessible font, and easy to read. This is used for more word heavy content sections of the website.

  Both fonts were sourced from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).


  #### Imagery

| Hero Image | - Each page features a hero image of XXX. | - Experiment with more options. | ![Hero Image About Page](docs/features/hero_image_about_page.PNG) ![Hero Image Discover Page](docs/features/hero_image_discover_page.PNG) ![Hero Image Sign Up Page](docs/features/hero_image_signup_page.PNG) ![Hero Image Response Page](docs/features/hero_image_response_page.PNG) |
| Colour | - Block colours are used where there's writing so they do not get lost in the sprinkles background. | ---| ![colour About Page](docs/features/colour_about_page.PNG)  ![colour Discover Page](docs/features/colour_discover_page.PNG) ![colour Sign Up Page](docs/features/colour_signup_page.PNG) ![colour Response Page](docs/features/colour_response_page.PNG) |
| Footer | - A focal point that stands out clearly with a white background. This is carried throughout each page as it is essential to create a strong social following as the concept of the website is community-based. | - Expand footer to include contact details, T&Cs, Privacy Policy etc. | ![Footer](docs/features/footer.PNG) |
| About | General landing page that describes what the website & what it is about. | - Add an image carousel. <br> - Add a map listing all hobbies in the area. <br> - Add a preview section of reviews from former clientel. | ![PAGE NAME](docs/features/WEBSITE_NAME/PAGE_NAME.PNG)  |
| Discover | This is the main directory page. It features a gallery of the hobbies that the website is connected to (actual links to be implemented at later stage of development). They are displayed in rows of three on desktop and collapse responsively with decreasing screen size. This page illustrates what is available through the website with simple visual cues. | Once data is collected from those wanting to promote their business, club or facility it could be utilized across the website. Each hobby displayed would connect to the organisations offering those services. This would also include: <br> - Links to their socials, webpages, features and contact details. <br> - Add filter column to the directory with features such as "Onsite Parking", "Wheelchair Accessible" and "Sensory Friendly" to name a few.
