## Design

*SAMPLE*
The website is designed with three separate pages. This is to ensure ease of use, and for the length of each page to remain concise on a mobile device. It has an intuitive interface with clear navigation. This is emphasised with colour and imagery, allowing for quick access to facilities and respective socials.


  ### Colour Scheme

  There is a great emphasis on ...... for this website. I wanted it to reflect... <br>
  The colour scheme of the website illustrates...

  ![Hero Image](assets/images/hero.png)

  This palette holds...Many of the colours were extracted from this image and are accented throughout the website.

  ![Website Colour Palette](docs/colour-palette.png)

  This palette extracts......found in the hero image. It is used primarily for defining elements such as headings, areas of importance or quick reference.

  ![Website Colour Palette](docs/colour-palette-2.png)

  Both colour palettes were created using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.


  ### Typography

*SAMPLE*
    - This font has an illustration-type quality to it, which reflects the theme of the website. It adds some fun, looks hand-drawn and mirrors the chosen style of favicon. It is illustrative, yet has a structural integrity and readability to it. Furthermore, it effortlessly reflects what the website is about. This is primarily used for the website heading "Hobby".

  [Name of font](https://link_to_font_here)
